The deal was a tax inversion, a merger that would bring the new company\\u0026#8217;s headquarters out of the US—and out of reach of many US taxes. Thanks to the comparatively high US tax rate and \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/255790/how-big-business-buys-the-right-to-dodge-us-taxes/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ea corporate tax code that privileges overseas cash\\u003C/a\\u003E and profit shifting, lots of companies—especially pharmaceutical firms, which have lots of intellectual property that can be that can be steered to low-tax jurisdictions—have been trying to take advantage of the structure.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut many US politicians are unhappy about the development, which erodes the American tax base. Last month, after Burger King found a tax-inversion opportunity that would move the fast-food chain\\u0026#8217;s headquarters to Canada, the Obama administration \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/269829/did-barack-obama-just-crack-down-on-tax-inversions-or-what/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Etightened the rules\\u003C/a\\u003E for companies seeking to complete these transactions. It wasn\\u0026#8217;t clear whether this would mean merely tinkering around the edges or having enough impact to prevent the deals from going through. AbbVie\\u0026#8217;s decision to cancel its merger shows that the provisions do have some teeth; it remains to be seen if the Burger King deal or other high-profile inversions, like those planned by Medtronic and Chiquita, will be affected.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGonzalez, who thought the tax impact of his merger was of secondary importance just months ago, is now agitating for full-scale corporate tax reform. With the Republican party expecting to control the US legislature after next month\\u0026#8217;s election, it\\u0026#8217;s likely that reform proposals intended to ease companies\\u0026#8217; efforts to shift earnings overseas will gain traction, but they will find it hard to pass them while Barack Obama is still president. A long-awaited tax reform plan will likely keep waiting, at least until the results of the 2016 elections are in, barring an unexpected willingness to compromise by either party.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=284639\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/284639/the-us-government-actually-stood-up-to-a-would-be-corporate-tax-dodger/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-10-21T09:55:10-04:00\",\"category\":\"Borders\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=284639\",\"dc_creator\":\"Tim Fernholz\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/us-keeper-save.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"US-keeper-save\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/us-keeper-save.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/284639/the-us-government-actually-stood-up-to-a-would-be-corporate-tax-dodger/"], ["published_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 13:55:10 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The US government actually stood up to a would-be corporate tax dodger"], ["updated_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 14:06:18 UTC +00:00]]

About half of India\\u0026#8217;s coal reserves—the fifth largest in the world—that is available above 600 meters is low-quality coal, former Coal India chairman S. Narsing Rao \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/should-coal-be-denationalised-112082900014_1.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Epointed out\\u003C/a\\u003E in 2012. \\u0026#8220;If the private sector, including multinational corporations, is allowed to mine coal for commercial purposes, it will probably stick to producing from areas that have a low cost of production and high quality of coal,\\u0026#8221; he argued.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESince Jaitley wants to safeguard Coal India, it can\\u0026#8217;t exactly allow private firms into these lucrative coal assets and ask the state-run miner to look elsewhere.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMuch of India\\u0026#8217;s unexploited coal reserves lie in remote areas with inadequate transportation infrastructure. If private firms are asked to look at these assets, they will be forced to build expensive infrastructure to extract coal from these mines. This new transport infrastructure will then have to be linked with existing railway routes—that already moves about half of India\\u0026#8217;s coal—for further movement. Coordination between Coal India and the railways is already problematic, so adding private miners in the mix won\\u0026#8217;t make things any better.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMoreover, with Coal India selling coal at a subsidized price, it\\u0026#8217;s unclear how private firms will recover these large investments since pricing their coal according to international benchmarks will drive up cost for customers—primarily power, steel and cement sectors—who will then want to pass on the cost to the end-consumer. Industry is unlikely to react happily. And if the government forces miners to keep their prices low, private players can\\u0026#8217;t be expected to queue up.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn short, opening up the sector to private miners while fully safeguarding Coal India\\u0026#8217;s interests, is going to be a tightrope walk.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;In the current situation, it\\u0026#8217;s not right to get merchant miners into the sector,\\u0026#8221; an analyst told Quartz, requesting anonymity since the details of the policy aren\\u0026#8217;t public yet, \\u0026#8220;Till Coal India\\u0026#8217;s share (of the market) goes down, it is not possible in the next few years.\\u0026#8221; And reducing dependence on Coal India would primarily happen through an increase in captive mining.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat may be exactly what finance minister Jaitley intends on doing by streamlining the coal auction process—and by refusing to give a clear timeline on allowing private players.

He asked Polak how much of Gandhi’s teaching he thought survived in India. “Ostensibly a great deal… In reality, very little,” said Polak.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndeed, neither India nor the Congress Party ever accepted Gandhi’s doctrine of non-violence as creed. “The Congress Party, including Nehru and other prominent leaders such as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, accepted non-violence but only as a method. With them it was an instrument of political practice, not an article of faith,” wrote Moraes.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the 56 years since his article, the situation has only worsened. Very little of the Mahatma\\u0026#8217;s politics has survived in India; we could, however, despite our reluctance, take pride in our ability to export an enduring brand. It is perhaps more relevant to the world than to India, mostly because we have chosen to take a path different from his.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat probably was a good reason why Richard Attenborough’s film on the man many Britons hated won the Oscar for best film. That probably was also the reason for the U.S. Congress to pass a special legislation allowing the Mahatma’s statute in Washington to be installed on government land.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhile we, as a nation, use him on occasions of political exigencies, the world only wants more of Gandhi for his political thought.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EMyriad Mahatmas\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndeed, the metallic Mahatma is much in demand. Under a well-structured programme run jointly by India’s overseas missions, which work out the modalities of the placement of statues and busts, and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) that pays the sculptors who make the statutes, replicas of the bespectacled apostle of peace are regularly shipped to the world.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBetween 2001 and 2010, nearly 70 busts and statues of the Mahatma were sent to dozens of countries by the ICCR. That’s an average of seven a year. The bust I saw in Djibouti was sent in 2003 for installation on a street named after the Mahatma. The cigar chewing Mr. Churchill, who never regretted his long-time rival’s death, hasn’t had it so good!\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Mahatma’s statue is due to be unveiled at the Parliament Square in London next year alongside those of Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela—the man who was so influenced by Gandhi as he led his people to an apartheid-free South Africa. Churchill’s statue is one of the 10 already erected at this place.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EOwning Gandhi\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHere, at home, he still has an occasional use. The stamp of moral authority that he has left on this nation means the Mahatma—though a Congress man—can be greedily adopted by other political parties when required. Modi’s effort to make him the face of his “Clean India” campaign is just another example of Gandhi’s use for political convenience.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDespite promising to build a towering statue of Patel in the run up to the general elections that swept him to power, Modi now wants his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government to own “Brand Gandhi” and take over the events that mark the death and birth anniversaries of the Mahatma. Up until now, these ceremonies were the responsibility of a special committee constituted by an Act of parliament.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Mahatma’s adoption by the BJP—the political face of an organization whose members celebrated the Mahatma’s death—is ironic, but then that’s the strength of a brand that has endured the rough and tumble of time.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"edition-credit india\\\"\\u003EThis article is a part of Quartz India.

Taxes didn’t go up despite our decade-long engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. The resulting disconnect between the military and the civilian population has been cited as a source of concern by General Stan McChrystal, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and many others. MSNBC host Chris Hayes points out that the proportion of congressmen who had served in the military is now lower than for the population at large, while the reverse had been true up to 1995; we also have shown a greater propensity to project military force since around the same time.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI don’t recall a single person from my time at either Exeter or Brown who went into the armed forces. One woman the year below me at Columbia Law School joined the JAG Corps afterwards—I remember this in part because she was so unusual. For people who graduated from Brown or similar institutions, the notion of \\u0026#8220;service\\u0026#8221; tends to take less the form of \\u0026#8220;join the army\\u0026#8221; and more \\u0026#8220;go help some people.\\u0026#8221; Although Harvard, Yale, and Columbia have recently reinstated ROTC, there are more prevalent non-military service options for students, including Teach for America, the Peace Corps, City Year, and similar programs and organizations. The message is that service means working with children, teaching the poor, working at a non-profit and that sort of activity.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI’ll confess that I never realistically considered any of these options when I graduated from college in the mid-90s. I went directly to law school and became a corporate attorney. I did a few things such that I still felt somewhat pro-social (e.g., I took on a pro bono asylum case for an indigent woman, volunteered for friends’ organizations when asked), but these activities were peripheral to the basic cause of succeeding professionally.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI’m far from unique. There are a ton of young people whose goal it is to get a good job at a good firm, pay some bills, get a date, get an apartment, buy some furniture, etc. and maybe volunteer on the side. These impulses are healthy and positive. Teddy Roosevelt remarked that a man’s first duty is to provide for himself and his family; only after this has been done can he be of service to the general public. Today, with women experiencing higher educational attainment than men, I’m sure the same could be applied across gender lines.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAfter arriving at the law firm though, I found practicing corporate law to be a poor fit. It wasn’t because I wasn’t helping people or doing something noble. The problem for me was that my work felt fungible and pointless. I wasn’t creating any value. My reviewing documents was a transaction cost. Someone else could step in and take my place and the world would be exactly the same.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI left to co-found a startup, Stargiving.com, that used the internet to help celebrities raise money more effectively for their favorite non-profits using sponsored clicks (\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://freerice.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ethink freerice.com\\u003C/a\\u003E but with celebrities offering to meet people who clicked on their cause). The company didn’t work out, I’m sure in part because I had little idea what I was doing. I went from there to a mobile software company and a health care software company, eventually becoming the CEO of Manhattan GMAT, a test prep company that was acquired by the Washington Post.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI could say that these roles were about helping people (raising money for charities, making hospitals more efficient, helping young people achieve their goals, etc.) but that wasn’t why I did any of them. The important factor was that I thought I was making a difference for the organization each day. I just wanted to feel that my work mattered, and that I was developing in a direction I wanted to go. It was less about the activity itself and more about what I was accomplishing.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt least for me, the metrics were less about \\u0026#8220;am I helping people?”—it was more, was I creating value? Am I having an impact? Did I value the people around me? Was I becoming a better person or professional over time? If I stopped showing up, would it matter? I founded Venture for America in large part to drive our talented young people to environments where they could answer these questions in a positive way. Venture for America channels enterprising graduates to early-stage companies in Detroit, Baltimore, New Orleans, St. Louis and other US cities to promote job growth and train the next generation of entrepreneurs. Our goal is to help create 100,000 new US jobs by 2025.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPeople who enlist for military service or devote their lives to the unfortunate are clearly worthy of praise and admiration. At the same time, military service isn’t a realistic option for many, and I’ve seen tons of idealistic young people go work for large non-profits and organizations only to become frustrated with their roles or burnt out. In my view, if we broaden the notion of service to include \\u0026#8220;helping organizations succeed,\\u0026#8221; \\u0026#8220;creating value,\\u0026#8221; and \\u0026#8220;generating new opportunities for yourself and others,\\u0026#8221; we’ll give many young people license to take on pursuits that are more sustainable for them and will drive society forward.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EJob creation and paths to the middle class are today what our economy and society need most. If you examine our communities, what we need as much as anything else are new companies that help enliven neighborhoods and give people meaningful avenues for personal advancement. Nothing conveys a sense of self-worth like the right opportunity. This is the new call to service—“Can you create 5, or 50, or 500 jobs for people in Detroit, New Orleans, Providence, or Baltimore?” Success will drive our ability to educate our children and many other things.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt’s time we posed a different vision of service to our young people that addresses the needs of today. Business formation and economic dynamism are at record lows. We need new businesses to drive job creation and new opportunities. If our young people decide to take on the challenge of revitalizing our country’s economy, they’ll grow to become precisely the kind of people and builders we need them to be.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe challenge that lies ahead is to make the path to entrepreneurship as well-lit and supported as other more conventional paths. Imagine if we gave each aspiring entrepreneur the same level of support and resources that currently go to aspiring lawyers and doctors, both of which often receive $100,000+ apiece in federally subsidized education loans and praise from all around them. In my experience, entrepreneurship is a lonely endeavor. We can make it less so and make it possible to serve both oneself and society.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EYou can follow Andrew on Twitter at \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/AndrewYangVFA\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E@AndrewYangVFA\\u003C/a\\u003E.

So to make these determinations, it relied solely on the data it collected in the previous year from billions of search results displayed on its website. This means that the buy-two-weeks-in-advance figure it gave us this year was actually the best time to buy last year. It also means that when Kayak said that the best time to buy in 2013 was 12 weeks out, they were off by 10 weeks.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn average, a flyer who followed Kayak\\u0026#8217;s advice last year would have paid 4.6% more for the fare than if they were able to buy at the time of lowest fares.

Does it look more like last year or 2012? After repeated requests from Quartz, Kayak declined to provide data from its search results in 2014, which could better shed light on current pricing trends. Kayak says that looking at the previous year\\u0026#8217;s data is the best way to predict when to buy, and that the 2014 data is \\u0026#8220;not actionable\\u0026#8221; because it\\u0026#8217;s incomplete and backward looking. It does not explain why data from the previous year would be any more actionable, though.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ELooking at how the previous years played out, we observe only two main things that have remained consistent in Kayak\\u0026#8217;s fare data.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EBooking very early will cost you money. \\u003C/strong\\u003EThe price of a Thanksgiving-time ticket is near its most expensive in July and August.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EBooking very late will cost you money. \\u003C/strong\\u003EThe only thing more expensive than booking in August is booking less than a week before the holiday.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cfigure id=\\\"image-284332\\\" class=\\\"inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"inline-image-tools\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"#\\\" class=\\\"share-button\\\" data-image-id=\\\"284332\\\"\\u003EShare\\u003C/a\\u003E\\n\\t\\t\\t\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"share-icons desaturated\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F283882%2Fwhy-kayak-has-always-been-wrong-about-the-best-time-to-book-your-holiday-flights%2Fi%2F284332%2F\\u0026text=Why+Kayak+has+always+been+wrong+about+the+best+time+to+book+your+holiday+flights\\u0026via=qz\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-twitter\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F283882%2Fwhy-kayak-has-always-been-wrong-about-the-best-time-to-book-your-holiday-flights%2Fi%2F284332%2F\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-facebook\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"help-text\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ci class=\\\"icon-zoom\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/i\\u003ETap image to zoom\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/average-fare-of-a-thanksgiving-flight-in-the-us-in-2010-in-2012-in-2013_chartbuilder_pct.png?w=640\\\" data-retina=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/average-fare-of-a-thanksgiving-flight-in-the-us-in-2010-in-2012-in-2013_chartbuilder_pct.png?w=1024\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\"/\\u003E\\u003C/figure\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=283882\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/283882/why-kayak-has-always-been-wrong-about-the-best-time-to-book-your-holiday-flights/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-10-21T07:00:24-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=283882\",\"dc_creator\":\"David Yanofsky\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/rtxv0p4-e1413833992740.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"RTXV0P4\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/rtxv0p4-e1413833992740.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/283882/why-kayak-has-always-been-wrong-about-the-best-time-to-book-your-holiday-flights/"], ["published_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 11:00:24 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Why Kayak has always been wrong about the best time to book your holiday flights"], ["updated_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 14:06:18 UTC +00:00]]

This site is made up of \\u0026amp;quot;sub\\u0026amp;quot;reddits, which are all their own communities. Every single post you see on this site belongs to its own community, with its own set of users, and with its own set of rules. reddit provides you an easy-to-use interface for managing what posts you see by letting you subscribe or unsubscribe from certain subreddits. \\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;By making an account, you are automatically subscribed to a set of \\u0026amp;quot;default\\u0026amp;quot; subreddits which are a set of highly popular communities that the administrators of this site feel would give the average person an interesting first experience. \\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;Don\\u0026amp;#39;t like one or more of these default subreddits?

Find subreddits that interest \\u0026lt;em\\u0026gt;you\\u0026lt;/em\\u0026gt;. Many subreddits feature lists of \\u0026amp;quot;similar subreddits\\u0026amp;quot; that will help you find other awesome places to subscribe to. Looking for a subreddit but you just don\\u0026amp;#39;t know its name? Try \\u0026lt;a href=\\u0026#34;/r/findareddit\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;/r/findareddit\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;!

At the top you will find a link to submit a post and a link to search the subreddit. It also contains the link to \\u0026amp;quot;subscribe/unsubscribe\\u0026amp;quot; from that subreddit.

Every subreddit has a sidebar. Please don\\u0026amp;#39;t forget to look for it even if your app doesn\\u0026amp;#39;t immediately show it! \\u0026lt;a href=\\u0026#34;http://imgur.com/a/kgwuy#0\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;Here\\u0026amp;#39;s an image showing where to find it on common reddit apps.\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;You should always read the sidebar before submitting a post to any subreddit, and if you don\\u0026amp;#39;t understand a rule message the moderators to ask. This ensures that your post stays on the subreddit, as rule-breaking posts will likely be removed.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;Have a question about a submission to a particular subreddit?

The mods are volunteers who ensure the subreddit stays true to its purpose by enforcing set rules. For example, \\u0026lt;a href=\\u0026#34;/r/android\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;/r/android\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt; is a subreddit dedicated to discussion of the Android operating system. Anything not directly related to Android is removed by its moderators. Similarly, \\u0026lt;a href=\\u0026#34;/r/apple\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;/r/apple\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt; is a subreddit dedicated to discussing Apple and its products. \\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;Moderators have the power to approve or remove any comments or submissions made to \\u0026lt;em\\u0026gt;only the subreddits they moderate.\\u0026lt;/em\\u0026gt; They can also issue a ban for users on their subreddit. Moderators enforce the rules laid out in the sidebar, so if you follow all the rules in the sidebar you should be good! \\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/ul\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;strong\\u0026gt;Who are admins?

They have all the abilities of moderators across every subreddit plus more. They are paid employees of the site and they ensure that the site runs smoothly for all users.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;The admins are generally hands-off when it comes to individual subreddits, letting the moderators and the community decide how its run. \\u0026lt;strong\\u0026gt;However,\\u0026lt;/strong\\u0026gt; the admins will enforce the \\u0026lt;a href=\\u0026#34;http://www.reddit.com/rules\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;rules of reddit\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt; on every subreddit. Be familiar with these rules. Failure to follow these rules may earn you a \\u0026lt;strong\\u0026gt;sitewide ban\\u0026lt;/strong\\u0026gt;, or the closing down of a subreddit. \\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/ul\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;hr/\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;strong\\u0026gt;What is reddiquette?\\u0026lt;/strong\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;ul\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a href=\\u0026#34;http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;reddiquette\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt; is an \\u0026lt;strong\\u0026gt;informal\\u0026lt;/strong\\u0026gt; set of guidelines to follow before commenting or submitting on reddit. As reddit has grown, certain behaviors have been frowned upon and other behaviors have been encouraged. reddiquette spells out these behaviors so you aren\\u0026amp;#39;t left wondering why your posts aren\\u0026amp;#39;t well-received. You might not be banned not following reddiquette, but you will probably be showered in downvotes if you don\\u0026amp;#39;t.\\u0026lt;br/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/ul\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;hr/\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;strong\\u0026gt;Help!

Many posts are made here every day. Many, many posts are made with the intention to spam or harass other users. Other posts just don\\u0026amp;#39;t fit the subreddit. Moderators have to filter through these posts every day to ensure their subreddit stays on topic and free of hostility. Some moderators use bots to help them report posts, some moderators do it all themselves. Every subreddit is different. If you find your post not showing up in the subreddit, your best bet is to ask the moderators there why it\\u0026amp;#39;s not showing up. \\u0026lt;em\\u0026gt;Please note: when you message the moderators, ALL moderators can read it!

First though, make sure that you talk to the moderators of that subreddit just to be sure there aren\\u0026amp;#39;t any misunderstandings, or if you can\\u0026amp;#39;t just compromise.
