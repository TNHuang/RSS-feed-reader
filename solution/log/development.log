The $19 billion price tag Whatsapp got earlier this year was a reminder of the value��in getting young people in the developing world depend on you for their communication.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFrom its launch in 2012, Hike has grown rapidly. In July, it was the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://hike.in/blog/hike/the-1-app-of-india/\\\"\\u003Emost downloaded app\\u003C/a\\u003E in India on��both the India��Apple app store and the Google Play store for Android devices. The company claims��35 million users, of which about��half��are active. Some 80% of the users are under 25 years of age, according to the company.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhatsapp is still way ahead in India, having been popular even before Hike was born.��But the two-year old Hike is confident that it can carve a niche for itself in the Indian market.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;We believe there will be two messaging apps in this country,\\u0026#8221; said 26-year-old Kavin, who met us in his chic glass-walled office in Gurgaon. \\u0026#8220;One is simple messaging, WhatsApp would be that company, the second is much more rich form of messaging. We believe Hike is going to be the other one.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn order to woo Indian users, Hike has added many features that WhatsApp lacks. It allows users to password-protect certain chats. You can also set privacy levels for individuals. For instance, you can decide whether a person can see that you have seen their message or not.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;Lots of Indian kids live with their parents till they are 24 or 25 and they don\\u0026#8217;t have privacy and sometimes they share a phone with the family,\\u0026#8221; explained Kavin. \\u0026#8220;Kids chat all night and they don\\u0026#8217;t want their parents to know.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThey also \\u0026#8220;reward\\u0026#8221; users for being on Hike. You can earn Rs20 (in mobile talk time) for each friend you invite to Hike, a price that Kavin believes is not much for customer acquisition.

But there are certain features that WhatsApp doesn\\u0026#8217;t have\\u0026#8230; which work in favor of Hike.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EWants to clock��100 million users\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMittal studied engineering at��Imperial College in the United Kingdom and has��interned with McLaren, Google and Goldman Sachs.

Recent surveys conducted by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation suggest that \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/236809/the-idea-of-chindia-never-really-got-very-far-jindia-has-better-prospects/\\\"\\u003Ecorporate Japan is bullish\\u003C/a\\u003E on India. The South Asian giant tops the list of most important markets for long-term Japanese investment.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAkihiko Tanaka, president of the Japan International Cooperation Agency, a government-backed aid body, believes Japan can help India grow into a China-like economic power. \\u0026#8220;India could grow into an economic powerhouse on par with China,\\u0026#8221; \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/indias-modi-visits-japan-to-deepen-defense-and-commercial-ties-1409244018\\\"\\u003Ehe told the Wall Street Journal\\u003C/a\\u003E. \\u0026#8220;Japan should help India build a robust economy and become an anchor of the region.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EStill, Japan���s FDI into India fell in \\u003Ca href=\\\"tel:2012-2103\\\"\\u003E2012-2103\\u003C/a\\u003E, according to the Reserve Bank of India, dropping from $2 billion in the 2011-12 fiscal year to $1.3 billion.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EModi wants���and needs���just about everything, but particularly investments in infrastructure and manufacturing. India���s infrastructure needs are well-known. Nearly one in three Indians have no regular access to electricity���400 million people. Roads are mostly poor, and its railways need dramatic revamping. Ports and airports across the country are also in need of investment. The list goes on and on. The question is, of course, if Modi can ���open��� India for investment in the same way he ���opened��� Gujarat.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen he was Chief Minister of Gujarat, his exploits were legendary in the business community: cutting through bureaucracy, lightning speed permits for investors, and an annual investment conference that would have made the World Economic Forum of Davos-fame proud.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn Modi���s Independence Day speech on August 15, he made a passionate appeal for\\u0026#8230;manufacturing. Yes, manufacturing. In a cinematic scene straight out of Bollywood, the son of the tea-seller who rose to the highest office in the land spoke before tens of thousands and hundreds of millions across the nation from the ramparts of a former Mughal palace, and he said: ���I want to appeal all the people world over, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, ���Come, make in India���, ���Come, manufacture in India���. Sell in any country of the world but manufacture here. We have got skill, talent, discipline, and determination to do something���Our country is powerful. Come, I am giving you an invitation.���\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAn effort by Shinzo Abe���s administration to support Japanese corporates to deliver on the goal of manufacturing in India would go a long way toward bolstering Modi���s credibility which, even amid Modi-mania, has already shown signs of faltering as an impatient populace grows hungry for the Modi ���miracle��� to deliver.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs for Modi, he will need to show Abe that he is more than just a salesman with a briefcase full of India opportunities. He will need to demonstrate a seriousness of purpose in issues related to broader Asian security beyond India���s immediate South Asian neighbors. The defense agreement is a good start.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EShortly after Modi���s visit to Japan, he will welcome Chinese President Xi Jinping to Delhi. Two weeks later, he will visit Washington. September will, thus, be a defining month in Indian foreign policy.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn Tokyo, Modi would do well to speak the language of common Asian security, and seek ways to tamp down tensions in the South China Sea. One avenue would be to convene an Indian Ocean/South China Sea commercial forum. The focus on commerce would fit well with Modi���s mandate, while linking the future of the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea would serve Tokyo���s broader Asian security agenda. It would also get Beijing���s attention in a positive way: commercial security.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBy choosing such a path, Modi would be delivering a powerful message to both China and Japan: India is open for business, and commercial security remains, above all, Delhi���s priority.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESuch a stance will not substantively reduce Tokyo-Beijing tensions, but neither will it add to them. That, in and of itself, would represent a victory for both men.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=257568\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/257568/what-abe-and-modi-need-from-each-other/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-08-30T09:13:26-07:00\",\"category\":\"Modinomics\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=257568\",\"dc_creator\":\"Afshin Molavi\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/08/rtxh4ab1.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"- UNDATED PHOTO - This montage picture shows Japan\\u0026#039;s newest and fastest bullet train, the 500-type N..\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/08/rtxh4ab1.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/257568/what-abe-and-modi-need-from-each-other/"], ["published_at", Sat, 30 Aug 2014 16:13:26 UTC +00:00], ["title", "What Abe and Modi need from each other"], ["updated_at", Mon, 01 Sep 2014 04:51:04 UTC +00:00]]
